#A filter tailored to endgame farmers and crafters based on PoEDave's Fubgun UberStrict filter, with several additions that make finding craftable items easier.

#Key: 
#Normal Rarity = White Text and Border, Magic Rarity = Cyan Text and Border, Rare Rarity = Gold Text and Border
#Item levl 82 or higher = Green Border
#Certain highly sought after items have more unique text colors (such as the dualstring, visceral quiver, and primed quiver). 
#These highly sought items have an orange border for items below lvl 82 and green border for items above lvl 82.
#There are special colors for breach rings and other event drops, such as breach splinters, artifacts, etc.
